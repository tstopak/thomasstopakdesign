    <p>
      Apple music cost me around $5.00 a month and is fantastic! Normally,
      I'm not a fan of anything apple, but this deal is hard to be beat. I got it
      this cheap by going through unidays.com. Unidays is a website that gives
      students who go to eligible colleges discounts on all kinds of products.
      As a Capital student all I had to do was select Capital from the list of
      schools and sign up with my school email. From there I had to verify my email.
      Afterwards I was able to link my AppleId to my unidays account and got the
      student discount on Apple music. So what do you get for the price you ask?
      You get access to most songs to download to your device, and they work
      as long as your subscription is valid. You also get access to personalized
      suggestions, top charts, artist/genre radio stations. The real beauty is that
      you are able to download the music, which means for people like me who
      don't have unlimited data, this won't eat away at your data every time you are
      out and about listening to music. I would say this product is a must have for everyone. <br><br>
      For those of you who have family who might be interested there is also the option to
      sign up on a family plan, which ends up being cheaper per person than it would be
      buying the subscriptions seperately. Not only is it cheaper, but it adds a little more
      functionality. If you are on a family plan you can share your music with your family.
      This is something I would like to get to play with more, as I have brothers with
      similar taste in music to mine. Maybe I'll try getting the whole family onboard when
      I go home this break. Anyways, if you don't have Apple Music, go get it NOW!!
      You won't regret it.

      If you haven't already checked out the Joe Rogan Expeirence Podcast I highly recommend. For those
      of you who don't know who Joe is, he is the former host of fear factor, a comedian,
      and an MMA commentator who is heavily involved in the UFC. Joe is down right hilarious
      and there is never a dry morning listening to his podcast while sipping my coffee. You can
      access the podcast via Itunes, or watch the video recording on Youtube. He always nails down
      awesome guests. Some recent guests included comedian Brian Regan,Tom Delonge from the band
      Blink-182,  and Actor/Comedian Russel Brand. Joe discusses all kinds of things on the podcast
      from fight recaps to current events and all kinds of other assorted topics. You also will always
      have new content to listen to/watch as Joe uploads every day Monday through Friday.
